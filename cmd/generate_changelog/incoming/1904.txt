### PR [#1904](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric/pull/1904) by [majiayu000](https://github.com/majiayu000): fix: resolve WebUI tooltips not rendering due to overflow clipping

- Fix: resolve WebUI tooltips not rendering due to overflow clipping by using position: fixed and getBoundingClientRect() to calculate tooltip position dynamically, preventing tooltips from being clipped by parent containers with overflow: hidden
- Refactor: extract tooltip positioning logic into separate positioning.ts module for better code organization and maintainability
- Improve accessibility with aria-describedby attributes and unique IDs for better screen reader support
- Add reactive tooltip position updates on scroll and resize events for dynamic positioning
- Add SSR safety with isBrowser flag check and comprehensive unit test coverage for the positioning functions
