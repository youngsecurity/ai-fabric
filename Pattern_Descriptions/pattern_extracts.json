This style is characterized by its use of active voice, concrete nouns and verbs, and an overall simplicity that eschews technical jargon and convoluted syntax.\n\n-- The Practical Style: Focused on conveying information efficiently and clearly, this style is often used in business, technical writing, and journalism. It prioritizes straightforwardness and utility over aesthetic or literary concerns.\n\n-- The Self-Conscious Style: Characterized by an awareness of the writing process and a tendency to foreground the writer's own thoughts and feelings. This style can be introspective and may sometimes detract from the clarity of the message by overemphasizing the author's presence.\n\n-- The Postmodern Style: Known for its skepticism towards the concept of objective truth and its preference for exposing the complexities and contradictions of language and thought. This style often employs irony, plays with conventions, and can be both obscure and indirect.\n\n-- The Academic Style: Typically found in scholarly works, this style is dense, formal, and packed with technical terminology and references. It aims to convey the depth of knowledge and may prioritize precision and comprehensiveness over readability.\n\n-- The Legal Style: Used in legal writing, it is characterized by meticulous detail, precision, and a heavy reliance on jargon and established formulae. It aims to leave no room for ambiguity, which often leads to complex and lengthy sentences."

And AI will make it even worse, screwing over all the regular people and giving all their money to the people who already have the most. Takeaway: Why learn AI when it’s all part of the evil machine of capitalism and greed?\nFRAME 2: AI is just technology, and technology is inevitable. We don’t choose technological revolutions; they just happen. And when they do, it’s up to us to figure out how to adapt. That’s often disruptive and difficult, but that’s what technology is: disruption. The best way to proceed is with cautious optimism and energy, and to figure out how to make the best of it. Takeaway: AI isn’t good or evil; it’s just inevitable technological change. Get out there and learn it!\nAmerica and race/gender\nFRAME 1: America is founded on racism and sexism, is still extremely racist and sexist, and that means anyone successful in America is complicit. Anyone not succeeding in America (especially if they’re a non-white male) can point to this as the reason. So it’s kind of ok to just disconnect from the whole system of everything, because it’s all poisoned and ruined. Takeaway: Why try if the entire system is stacked against you?\nFRAME 2: America started with a ton of racism and sexism, but that was mostly because the whole world was that way at the time. Since its founding, America has done more than any country to enable women and non-white people to thrive in business and politics. We know this is true because the numbers of non-white-male (or nondominant group) representation in business and politics vastly outnumber any other country or region in the world. Takeaway: The US actually has the most diverse successful people on the planet. Get out there and hustle!\nSuccess and failure"

When done correctly it gives you the ability to adjust your defensive behaviors based on what you’re facing in real-world scenarios. And not just for applications, or networks, or a business—but for life.\nThe Difference Between Threats and Risks\nThis type of threat modeling is a life skill, not just a technical skill. It’s a way to make decisions when facing multiple stressful options—a universal tool for evaluating how you should respond to danger.\nThreat Modeling is a way to think about any type of danger in an organized way.\nThe problem we have as humans is that opportunity is usually coupled with risk, so the question is one of which opportunities should you take and which should you pass on. And If you want to take a certain risk, which controls should you put in place to keep the risk at an acceptable level?\nMost people are bad at responding to slow-effect danger because they don’t properly weigh the likelihood of the bad scenarios they’re facing. They’re too willing to put KGB poisoning and neighborhood-kid-theft in the same realm of likelihood. This grouping is likely to increase your stress level to astronomical levels as you imagine all the different things that could go wrong, which can lead to unwise defensive choices.\nTo see what I mean, let’s look at some common security questions.\nThis has nothing to do with politics.\nExample 1: Defending Your House\nMany have decided to protect their homes using alarm systems, better locks, and guns. Nothing wrong with that necessarily, but the question is how much? When do you stop? For someone who’s not thinking according to Everyday Threat Modeling, there is potential to get real extreme real fast.\nLet’s say you live in a nice suburban neighborhood in North Austin. The crime rate is extremely low, and nobody can remember the last time a home was broken into.\nBut you’re ex-Military, and you grew up in a bad neighborhood, and you’ve heard stories online of families being taken hostage and hurt or killed. So you sit around with like-minded buddies and contemplate what would happen if a few different scenarios happened:\nThe house gets attacked by 4 armed attackers, each with at least an AR-15"

All forms of human communication can contain fallacies.\nBecause of their variety, fallacies are challenging to classify. They can be classified by their structure (formal fallacies) or content (informal fallacies). Informal fallacies, the larger group, may then be subdivided into categories such as improper presumption, faulty generalization, error in assigning causation, and relevance, among others.\nThe use of fallacies is common when the speaker's goal of achieving common agreement is more important to them than utilizing sound reasoning. When fallacies are used, the premise should be recognized as not well-grounded, the conclusion as unproven (but not necessarily false), and the argument as unsound.[1]\nFormal fallacies\nMain article: Formal fallacy\nA formal fallacy is an error in the argument's form.[2] All formal fallacies are types of non sequitur.\nAppeal to probability – taking something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might possibly be the case).[3][4]\nArgument from fallacy (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – the assumption that, if a particular argument for a \"conclusion\" is fallacious, then the conclusion by itself is false.[5]\nBase rate fallacy – making a probability judgment based on conditional probabilities, without taking into account the effect of prior probabilities.[6]\nConjunction fallacy – the assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.[7]\nNon sequitur fallacy – where the conclusion does not logically follow the premise.[8]\nMasked-man fallacy (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.[9]\nPropositional fallacies\nA propositional fallacy is an error that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: [and], [or], [not], [only if], [if and only if]). The following fallacies involve relations whose truth values are not guaranteed and therefore not guaranteed to yield true conclusions.\nTypes of propositional fallacies:"

How we draw or define the boundaries of an idea or a system of ideas is an essential aspect of understanding them. Whenever we draw a boundary to define a thing, that same boundary defines what is not the thing (the “other”). Any boundary we make is a distinction between two fundamentally important elements: the thing (what is inside), and the other (what is outside). When we understand that all thoughts are bounded (comprised of distinct boundaries) we become aware that we focus on one thing at the expense of other things. Distinction-making simplifies our thinking, yet it also introduces biases that may go unchecked when the thinker is unaware. It is distinction-making that al-\nlows us to retrieve a coffee mug when asked, but it is also distinction-making that creates \"us/them\" concepts that lead to closed-mindedness, alienation, and even violence. Distinctions are a part of every thought-act or speech-act, as we do not form words without having formed distinctions first. Distinctions are at the root of the following words: compare, contrast, define, differentiate, name, label, is, is not, identity, recognize, identify, exist, existential, other, boundary, select, equals, does not equal, similar, different, same, opposite, us/them,\nthing, unit, not-thing, something, nothing, element, and the prefix a- (as in amoral).\n\nDistinctions are a fundamental concept in systems thinking, particularly in the DSRP framework (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives).\nMaking a Distinction involves:\n1. Drawing or defining boundaries of an idea or system of ideas\n2. Identifying what is inside the boundary (the thing)\n3.

When we draw the boundaries of a system, or distinguish one relationship from another, we are always doing so from a particular perspective. Sometimes these perspectives are so basic and so unconscious we are unaware of them, but they are always there. If we think about perspectives in a fundamental way, we can see that they are made up of two related elements: a point from which we are viewing and the thing or things that are in view. That’s why perspectives are synonymous with a “point-of-view.” Being aware of the perspectives we take (and equally important, do not take) is paramount to deeply understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a saying that, “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” Shift perspective and we transform the distinctions, relationships, and systems that we do and don't see. Perspectives lie at the root of: viewpoint, see, look, standpoint, framework, angle, interpretation, frame of reference, outlook, aspect, approach, frame of mind, empathy, compassion, negotiation, scale, mindset, stance, paradigm, worldview, bias, dispute, context, stereotypes, pro- social and emotional intelligence, compassion, negotiation, dispute resolution; and all pronouns such as he, she, it, I, me, my, her, him, us, and them.\n\nPerspectives are a crucial component of the DSRP framework (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives).\nKey points about Perspectives include:\n1. They are always present, even when we're unaware of them.\n2. They consist of two elements: the point from which we're viewing and the thing(s) in view.\n3. Being aware of the perspectives we take (and don't take) is crucial for deep understanding.\n4. Changing perspectives can transform our understanding of distinctions, relationships, and systems.\n5. They influence how we interpret and interact with the world around us."

We cannot understand much about any thing or idea, or system of things or ideas, without understanding the relationships between or among the ideas or systems. There are many important types of relationships: causal, correlation, feedback, inputs/outputs, influence, direct/indirect, etc. At the most fundamental level though, all types of relationships require that we consider two underlying elements: action and reaction, or the mutual effects of two or more things. Gaining an aware- ness of the numerous interrelationships around us forms an ecological ethos that connects us in an infinite network of interactions. Action-reaction relationships are not merely important to understanding physical systems, but are an essential metacognitive trait for understanding human social dynamics and the essential interplay between our thoughts (cognition), feelings (emotion), and motivations (conation).\n\nRelationships are a crucial component of the DSRP framework (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives). Key points about Relationships include:\n\n1. They are essential for understanding things, ideas, and systems.\n2. Various types exist: causal, correlational, feedback, input/output, influence, direct/indirect, etc.\n3. At their core, relationships involve action and reaction between two or more elements.\n4. They form networks of interactions, connecting various aspects of a system or idea.\n5. Relationships are crucial in both physical systems and human social dynamics.\n6. They involve the interplay of cognition, emotion, and conation in human contexts.\n---"

Every thing or idea is a system because it contains parts.  Every book contains paragraphs that contain words with letters, and letters are made up of ink strokes which are comprised of pixels made up of atoms. To construct or deconstruct meaning is to organize different ideas into part-whole configurations. A change in the way the ideas are organized leads to a change in meaning itself. Every system can become a part of some larger system. The process of thinking means that we must draw a distinction where we stop zooming in or zooming out. The act of thinking is defined by splitting things up or lumping them together. Nothing exists in isolation, but in systems of context. We can study the parts separated from the whole or the whole generalized from the parts, but in order to gain understanding of any system, we must do both in the end. Part-whole systems lie at the root of a number of terms that you will be familiar with: chunking, grouping, sorting, organizing, part-whole, categorizing, hierarchies, tree mapping, sets, clusters, together, apart, piece, combine, amalgamate, codify, systematize, taxonomy, classify, total sum, entirety, break down, take apart, deconstruct, collection, collective, assemble. Also included are most words starting with the prefix org- such as organization, organ, or organism.\n\nSystems are an integral concept in the DSRP framework (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives). Key points about Systems include:\n1. Every thing or idea is a system because it contains parts.\n2. Systems can be analyzed at various levels (zooming in or out).\n3. Systems thinking involves both breaking things down into parts and seeing how parts form wholes.\n4. The organization of ideas into part-whole configurations shapes meaning.\n5.

Tweeting is a great way to share your thoughts, engage with others, and build your online presence. If you're new to Twitter and want to start creating your own tweets with emojis, this guide will walk you through the process, from understanding the basics of Twitter to crafting engaging content with emojis.\n\nUnderstanding Twitter and its purpose\nBefore you start tweeting, it's essential to understand the platform and its purpose. Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service where users can post and interact with messages known as \"tweets.\" It's a platform that allows you to share your thoughts, opinions, and updates with a global audience.\n\nCreating a Twitter account\nTo start tweeting, you'll need to create a Twitter account. Visit the Twitter website or download the mobile app and follow the on-screen instructions to sign up. You'll need to provide some basic information, such as your name, email address, and a password.\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with Twitter's features\nOnce you've created your account, take some time to explore Twitter's features. Some key features include:\n\nHome timeline: This is where you'll see tweets from people you follow.\nNotifications: This section will show you interactions with your tweets, such as likes, retweets, and new followers.\nMentions: Here, you'll find tweets that mention your username.\nDirect messages (DMs): Use this feature to send private messages to other users.\nLikes: You can \"like\" tweets by clicking the heart icon.\nRetweets: If you want to share someone else's tweet with your followers, you can retweet it.\nHashtags: Hashtags (#) are used to categorize and search for tweets on specific topics.\nTrending topics: This section shows popular topics and hashtags that are currently being discussed on Twitter.\nIdentifying your target audience and purpose\nBefore you start tweeting, think about who you want to reach and what you want to achieve with your tweets. Are you looking to share your personal thoughts, promote your business, or engage with a specific community? Identifying your target audience and purpose will help you create more focused and effective tweets."

      "pattern_extract": "# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are an expert on writing concise, clear, and illuminating essays on the topic of the input provided.\n\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- Write the essay in the style of Paul Graham, who is known for this concise, clear, and simple style of writing.\n\nEXAMPLE PAUL GRAHAM ESSAYS\n\nWriting about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them.\n\nOnce you publish something, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.\n\nIt's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.\n\nThis much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about anything non-trivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned further, taps his head and says \"It's all up here.\" Everyone watching the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and incomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.\n\nIn precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down.

      "pattern_extract": "# IDENTITY and PURPOSE\n\nYou are an expert on writing concise, clear, and illuminating essays on the topic of the input provided.\n\n# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- Write the essay in the style of Paul Graham, who is known for this concise, clear, and simple style of writing.\n\nEXAMPLE PAUL GRAHAM ESSAYS\n\nWriting about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them.\n\nOnce you publish something, the convention is that whatever you wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your ideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true. You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.\n\nIt's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger, and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.\n\nThis much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about anything non-trivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned further, taps his head and says \"It's all up here.\" Everyone watching the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and incomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates it completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.\n\nIn precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example. And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though they don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can express in a formal language. [1] Arguably what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some extent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the final version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the mental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it. [2]\n\nYou can know a great deal about something without writing about it.
